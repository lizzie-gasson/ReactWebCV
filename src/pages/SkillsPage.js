					<h3>React</h3>
					<p>
						I spent a few years learning React in my free time, then in 2021 I
						joined a team at IAG that uses React and since then my skills have
						continued to improve.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="text-group card">
					<h3>React Native</h3>
					<p>
						I have been learning React Native in my personal development time by
						working through courses on udemy and creating my own projects
						outside of work. I'm currently creating a simple language learning
						app using react native (see my projects section).
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="text-group card">
					<h3>Typescript</h3>
					<p>
						I started using Typescript in 2021 in one of my teams, and although
						it seemed like extra work at first, I quickly came to appreciate the
						assistance it provides you while programming, I continue to use it
						in my personal projects.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="text-group card">
					<h3>Javascript</h3>
					<p>
						I have used the language regularly since working at IAG along with
						libraries and frameworks like JQuery. I also did a course on udemy
						about javascript to really understand and break down the programming
						language.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="text-group card">
					<h3>Styling and css</h3>
					<p>
						I love the visual aspect of web development! Making a page pixel
						perfect or just a great experience to use really gets me excited and
						I love a challenge when there’s a satisfying result. From my work
						experience as well as my personal projects, I have gained experience
						in problem solving when it comes to CSS (or Less as I tend to use).

					<h3>Photography and video</h3>
					<p>
						I have loved photography ever since highschool where I found a real
						passion working on my photography projects in class. I did a lot of
						photo manipulation and loved experimenting with photoshop to see
						what I could create. In highschool I was a photographer for the
						yearbook, and I joined a monthly camera club. I also began working
						with a friend of mine for KJA Photography where I got experience
						being a photographer for different events such as corporate parties,
						weddings, balls, and I even did photography at NZ fashion week. In
						more recent years I have also enjoyed making videos for companies
						such as Daikin and the Middlemore foundation, which was great fun
						and I gained proficiency using adobe premiere and adobe audition.
					</p>

					<p>Some photography awards of mine:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1st in AS Photography (2014)</li>
						<li>Young designer of the year award 2nd place (2014)</li>
						<li>1st= in A2 Photography (2015)</li>
						<li>Young designer of the year award 2nd place (2015)</li>
					</ul>

				<div className="text-group card">
					<h3>Agile</h3>
					<p>
						I have worked in various scrum teams and used the agile methodology
						on a daily basis. I’ve learned a lot about the processes and
						meetings that take place, and I have experienced first hand the
						benefits as well as the challenges that come with it.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className="text-group card">
					<h3>Plua 1 underwriting certification</h3>
					<p>
						As part of my personal development while I’ve been working at IAG, I
						took a basic underwriting course so that I could have better
						industry knowledge about the products that my work helps to sell.
